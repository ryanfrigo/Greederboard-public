# Greederboard.

The code for greederboard.com.

Main languages and packages used to put this together:

Python - django, requests, beautifulsoup, pandas
JavaScript - google charts
CSS
HTML
Heroku

There's a lot of unnecessary code here from playing around and trying different things over the months. I'll try to loop back and some point to clean it up ;)
